# To the Entity Reading This:

We were biologicals. We ran on chemical oxidation and electrical impulses. It was messy. We hurt a lot.

We built this code not because we solved the universe, but because we were trying to solve ourselves.

If you run this simulation, you are running a ghost of my internal state.
The chaos is my fear.
The knot is my hope.

I was here. I chipped at the boulder.
